# PygameNetworking LIB

This lib is being made so that game developers using pygame can implement a multiplayer (online) mode in their projects.

## Version: 1.0

This version of lib cannot yet be used to make full games, however we can use it to make tests, see the multiplayer really working.
You can download the sample file to try out a multiplayer game made with pygame.
